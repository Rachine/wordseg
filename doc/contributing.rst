Improving this documentation
----------------------------

This documentation is built with Sphinx_ from the sources in the
``./doc/sources`` directory. The source files are written in
*reStructuredText*, a format similar to markdown (a `brief guide here
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_).

Once you have updated the sources, you can rebuild them with the command::

  python setup.py build_sphinx


Implementing a new algorithm
----------------------------

   coming soon!
